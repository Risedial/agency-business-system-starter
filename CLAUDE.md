# Agency Business System - Workspace Context

## System Purpose

This is a complete, self-sustaining agency business operating system combining:

1. **Hand-Raiser Lead Generation** - Qualified leads through social posts (zero cold outreach)
2. **Async Video Sales** - Close clients via 5-minute videos (zero sales calls)
3. **No-Meeting Fulfillment** - Deliver services via async communication (zero client meetings)
4. **Mechanical Daily Operations** - Execute through checklists (zero strategic improvisation)

All outputs persist in this workspace. The system is designed for copy-paste execution with minimal decision-making.

- **Hand Raiser Lead Generation** - Self-selection psychology, 2026 social media dynamics
- **Async Video Sales System** - 5-part video structure, no-call closing
- **2026 Agency Best Practices** - Async-first fulfillment, social listening

### Daily Operations (System Complete)

1. Open Claude Code in this directory (CLAUDE.md auto-loads)
2. Run `/next` to see what to do based on current metrics
3. Follow `/daily/QUICK-REFERENCE.md` for daily checklist
4. Use `/system/prompt-generator.html` for any prompt needs

### If You're Lost

- **Run `/next`** - tells you exactly what to do based on current state

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Read SESSION-START.md
- [ ] Run `/init` to bootstrap system

## Support & Troubleshooting

**State Issues:**
- STATE.json not updating → Run hook manually: `python3 .claude/hooks/update-state.py`
- Discrepancy between files → CLAUDE.md is source of truth, update manually

**Lost Context:**
- Fresh Claude session → CLAUDE.md auto-loads, run `/next`
- Forgot current phase → Check "Phase" in Current State section above

**Prompt Generator Issues:**
- Stale state → Click "Refresh State" button, hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Won't load → Check `/system/STATE.json` exists and is valid JSON

**Execution Issues:**
- Stuck on a phase → Run `/validate` to check completion
- Don't understand instructions → Read current phase file directly
- System not working → Return to SESSION-START.md for setup verification
