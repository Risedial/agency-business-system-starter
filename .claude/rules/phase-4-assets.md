# Objection Response Templates

## "I tried this before and it didn't work"

### Response Framework:
1. Acknowledge: "I totally get that. What specifically didn't work about it?"

### Differentiation Angle 1: Speed
"Most agencies take 60-90 days to see results. The reason yours didn't work is [they likely took too long and you gave up]. We deliver first [outcome] within 7 days, so you see traction immediately."

## Quality Criteria

Before marking complete:
- [ ] All 8 files created in `/assets` directory
- [ ] Each file follows fill-in-the-blank format
- [ ] Templates are specific and actionable (not vague)
- [ ] hand-raiser-posts.md has 10+ variations
- [ ] video-script-template.md has all 5 parts with timing
- [ ] follow-up-sequence.md has complete 24h-1week cadence
- [ ] objection-responses.md covers 6+ common objections
- [ ] All templates reference current niche/offer from CLAUDE.md
- [ ] No improvisation required to use templates

## Validation

Review each asset file:
1. Can it be used mechanically (fill in blanks and execute)?
2. Is it specific enough for immediate action?
3. Does it reference the methodology frameworks correctly?
4. Would a VA be able to use this without explanation?

If answer to any is "No", refine the template.

## After Completion

1. **Update CLAUDE.md:**
   - Set Phase to "Phase 5"
   - Add all created files to "Assets Created" list

2. **Test one template:**
   - Open hand-raiser-posts.md
   - Fill in blanks for your niche/offer
   - Verify it produces a usable post

## Next Phase

Proceed to Phase 5: Daily Operations Setup
