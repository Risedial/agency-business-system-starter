# Async Video Sales System - Detailed Reference

## System Overview

The async video sales system eliminates sales calls entirely by using pre-recorded 4-5 minute videos that follow a proven 5-part structure. Validated with 800+ clients closed without a single phone conversation (Frankie Fihn, Beyond The Agency Box).

## The 5-Part Structure

### Part 1: Hook (10-15 seconds)

**Purpose:** Personalize and establish relevance

**Formula:**
"Hey [Name], I saw you [specific action they took]..."

**Variations by Source:**

**From Hand Raiser Comment:**
"Hey [Name], I saw you commented on my post about [topic]. You mentioned you're trying to [their goal]..."

**From DM:**
"Hey [Name], thanks for reaching out about [topic]. I know you're looking for [outcome]..."

**From Referral:**
"Hey [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you need help with [problem]..."

**Key Principles:**
- Reference their SPECIFIC situation (not generic)
- Use their EXACT language from comment/DM
- Keep under 15 seconds (get to value quickly)
- Face on camera (personal connection)

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Too long (30+ seconds of introduction)
- ❌ Generic ("Thanks for your interest")
- ❌ Self-focused ("Let me tell you about my company")
- ✅ Specific, brief, their-language

---

### Part 2: Outcome Demonstration (60-90 seconds)

**Purpose:** Show what happens AFTER they work with you (not the process)

**Formula:**
- Show actual result
- Use screen recording
- Play 10-second example if possible
- Visual proof > verbal description

**Execution by Niche:**

**Lead Generation Services:**
- Screen record: Lead dashboard showing 47 calls in 30 days
- Play 10-second clip: Example call recording (with permission)
- Visual: "Here's what your dashboard looks like after working with us..."

**Service Delivery (Design, Development, etc.):**
- Screen record: Before/after comparison
- Show actual deliverable
- Visual: "Here's a recent project we completed for [similar client]..."

**Coaching/Consulting:**
- Screen record: Client testimonial (video clip or screenshot)
- Show metric improvement (revenue graph, conversion rate, etc.)
- Visual: "Here's the result [Client Name] got after our 8-week program..."

**E-commerce Optimization:**
- Screen record: Revenue dashboard showing increase
- Show specific metric improvements (conversion rate, AOV, etc.)
- Visual: "Here's the before/after for [Store Name]'s Shopify dashboard..."

**Best Practices:**
- Screen share for entire 60-90 seconds
- Narrate what they're seeing ("You're looking at...")
- Point to specific numbers ("See this 47 right here? Those are calls.")
- Show THEIR future ("This is what your dashboard will look like...")

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Explaining the PROCESS ("First we do research, then we...")
- ❌ Talking about features ("Our tool has this and this")
- ❌ Generic results ("We get great results")
- ✅ Showing specific, visual OUTCOME

---

### Part 3: Contextualized Price (20-30 seconds)

**Purpose:** Present price paired with deliverable (never price alone)

**Formula:**
"$[PRICE] per [TIMEFRAME] and you get [SPECIFIC DELIVERABLE]"

**Examples:**

**Lead Generation:**
"It's $3,000 per month, and you get 50-100 calls like the ones I just showed you. So if you break that down, that's about $40 per qualified call."

**Service Delivery:**
"It's $5,000 for the complete website redesign, and you get the before/after improvement I just showed you. Typically completes in 4-6 weeks."

**Coaching:**
"The 8-week program is $4,000, and you get the same framework that [Client Name] used to increase their revenue 25%. Includes weekly sessions and all materials."

**E-commerce:**
"We charge $2,500 per month for the optimization service, and you get the conversion rate improvements I just showed. Most clients see 15-25% revenue increase within 60 days."

**Value Anchoring Techniques:**

**Per-Unit Calculation:**
"$3,000 for 50 leads = $60 per lead. Most competitors charge $100-150 per lead."

**ROI Framing:**
"If just ONE of those 50 leads converts to a $5,000 job, you're profitable immediately."

**Time Value:**
"$4,000 for 8 weeks = $500 per week. Less than what you'd spend figuring this out yourself."

**Before/After Comparison:**
"You're currently spending $5K/month on ads and getting 20 leads. We'll get you 50-100 leads for $3K/month."

**Key Principles:**
- ALWAYS pair price with deliverable
- NEVER say "$X/month" alone
- Anchor to value (per lead, per hour saved, ROI)
- Keep under 30 seconds (don't over-explain price)

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ "It costs $3,000 per month" (no context)
- ❌ Long justification of price (defensive tone)
- ❌ Multiple pricing tiers (confusing)
- ✅ Brief, confident, value-anchored

### Part 4: Differentiation (30-45 seconds)

**Purpose:** Address "I tried this before" objection preemptively

**Formula:**
"The reason [previous attempt] didn't work is [X]. We handle that by [Y]."

**Differentiation Angles:**

**Angle 1: Speed**
"Unlike most agencies that take 60-90 days to see results, we deliver your first leads within 7 days. The reason? We use a pre-validated campaign template that's already proven to work in your niche."

**Angle 2: Process/Method**
"The difference with our approach is we target [specific audience] instead of [generic audience]. Most agencies go broad, we go narrow. That's why the calls you get are actually qualified for [specific outcome]."

**Angle 3: Guarantee**
"We're the only ones who guarantee [specific outcome] or you don't pay. Most agencies charge whether it works or not. We only get paid when you get results."

**Angle 4: Setup Simplicity**
"Unlike other solutions that require you to [complex requirement], we handle everything. You just give us [simple requirement], and we take care of the rest."

**Key Principles:**
- Focus on ONE differentiator (not laundry list)
- Compare to what they've tried before
- Explain the mechanism (WHY it's different)
- Keep under 45 seconds

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ Listing 5 different benefits (overwhelming)
- ❌ Generic differentiation ("We care more")
- ❌ Disparaging competitors (unprofessional)
- ✅ Specific, mechanism-focused, brief

---

### Part 5: Purchase Instructions (20-30 seconds)

**Purpose:** Remove ALL friction from "yes" to "paid"

**Formula:**
Exact steps → Timeline → Next touchpoint

**Examples:**

**Stripe Payment Link:**
"To get started, click the Stripe link I'll send you right after this video. Enter your payment info, and you'll get an onboarding email from me within 2 hours. We'll kick off the setup on [day], and you'll see your first leads within 7 days."

**Invoice/Bank Transfer:**
"I'll send you an invoice after this video. Once you send payment, reply to confirm, and I'll send the onboarding details same day. We'll start the work on [day], and you'll see first results by [date]."

**Calendar Booking (Only if Necessary):**
"If you have questions before starting, book a 15-minute call using the Calendly link below. Otherwise, if you're ready to go, just reply 'YES' to this email, and I'll send the payment link."

**Key Principles:**
- Exact steps (no ambiguity)
- Timeline for each step ("within 2 hours", "by Friday")
- Next touchpoint ("you'll get an email", "I'll send you")
- Friction removal (no "schedule a call to discuss")

**Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ "Let me know if you're interested" (vague CTA)
- ❌ "Let's schedule a call to go over details" (adds friction)
- ❌ No timeline given (uncertainty)
- ✅ Explicit steps, clear timeline, immediate action

## Video Production Best Practices

### Recording Setup

**Tool:** Loom (recommended for 2026)
- Built-in captions (accessibility + muted viewing)
- Mobile-optimized playback
- Analytics (see who watched, how much)
- Easy sharing (single link)

**Camera:**
- Webcam on for intro (Part 1: Hook)
- Screen share for demo (Part 2: Outcome)
- Camera can be on or off for Parts 3-5 (preference)

**Audio:**
- Use headset microphone (clear audio critical)
- Quiet room (no background noise)
- Test recording (check levels before)

**Visual:**
- Good lighting (face visible if on camera)
- Clean background (no clutter)
- Screen recorded content visible and readable

### Editing

**Don't Edit:**
- Minor fumbles are fine (feels authentic)
- "Um" or brief pauses are okay (human)
- Perfect = scripted feeling (avoid)

**Do Edit:**
- Long pauses (cut dead air)
- Major mistakes (re-record that section)
- Length exceeds 5 minutes (cut unnecessary parts)

### Delivery

**Subject Line:**
Include "video" in subject line
- Example: "Quick video about getting more roofing leads"
- 19%+ open rate boost (2026 data)

**Message Wrapper:**
Personalize the surrounding text (not the video itself)
- "Hey [Name], I know you're trying to [goal from comment]. Made this video with everything: [link]"

**Timing:**
Send within 4 hours of engagement (while interest is hot)

---

## Custom vs. Standardized Phases

### Phase 1: Custom Videos (Offer Validation)

**When:** First 10-20 prospects

**Purpose:**
- Learn what objections come up
- Test different hook variations
- Identify what resonates
- Refine outcome demonstration

**Process:**
1. Record new video for each prospect
2. Personalize hook based on their comment/DM
3. Use same 5-part structure
4. Note their questions/objections
5. Refine script based on patterns

**When to Stop:**
- 3+ clients closed (you've proven the offer)
- Recurring objections identified (you know what to address)
- Script is validated (you know what works)

---

### Phase 2: Standardized Video (Scaled Acquisition)

**When:** After offer validation

**Purpose:**
- Scale efficiency (record once, send to many)
- Consistent message (proven script)
- Time savings (no custom recording per prospect)

**Process:**
1. Record ONE master video using refined script
2. Address recurring objections in Part 4 (Differentiation)
3. Save as master version
4. For each prospect: Send same video with personalized wrapper
5. Only re-record if offer/market changes significantly

**Message Wrapper Personalization:**
- "Hey [Name], I know you're trying to [goal from their comment]. Made this quick video with everything: [link]"
- Personalize: Their name, their stated goal
- Standardize: The video itself

---

## Follow-Up Sequence (Text-Based)

### After Video Is Sent

**24 Hours - Check-In:**
"Hey [Name], wanted to make sure you saw the video I sent yesterday. Let me know if you have any questions after watching."

**48 Hours - Value Add:**
"Hey [Name], following up on the video. Most [niche] find the [specific part] most interesting. Here's an example of [additional proof]. Curious what you think?"

**72 Hours - Soft Close:**
"Hey [Name], last check-in. If the timing's not right, totally understand. If you want to get started, just reply and I'll send payment details."

**1 Week - Final Attempt:**
"Hey [Name], closing this opportunity on Friday. If you want the [outcome] we discussed, let me know by then. Otherwise I'll assume it's not the right fit right now."

**After 1 Week Post-Final:**
Mark as COLD in pipeline tracker, remove from active follow-up.

## Common Objections & Responses

### "I tried this before and it didn't work"

**Response Framework:**
1. Acknowledge: "I totally get that. What specifically didn't work about it?"
2. Listen for their answer
3. Differentiate: "The reason that didn't work is [X]. We handle that by [Y]."
4. Proof: "Here's a client who had the same issue: [show result]"

See `/assets/objection-responses.md` for complete templates.

## Metrics to Track

### Video Performance
- Send rate: Videos sent per day
- Open rate: % who click the link
- Watch rate: % who watch full video
- Reply rate: % who respond after watching
- Conversion rate: % who become clients

### Benchmarks (2026)
- Open rate: 60-80% (email), 80-90% (DM)
- Watch rate: 40-60% (full 5 minutes)
- Reply rate: 30-40%
- Conversion rate: 10-15%

**If below benchmarks:**
- Open rate low: Improve subject line/wrapper
- Watch rate low: Shorten video or improve hook
- Reply rate low: Add stronger CTA in Part 5
- Conversion rate low: Improve outcome demonstration or price contextualization
