# Phase 2: Workspace Foundation

## Prerequisites
- Phase 1 complete (research documents created)
- Will be executed automatically by `/init` command

## Deliverables
- 6 framework documents in `/docs`
- STATE.json initialized in `/system`
- State sync infrastructure verified

## Instructions

### Task 1: Create Framework Documents

Generate these 6 detailed framework files in `/docs`. Use the research from Phase 1 as foundation.

#### `/docs/offer-framework.md`

Create comprehensive offer construction guide with:

**Niche Selection Criteria:**
- Pain urgency (how badly do they need it?)
- Budget capacity (can they afford $1K-$10K/month?)
- Accessibility (can you reach them via LinkedIn/Facebook?)

**Offer Summary Formula:**
```
[Niche] + [Specific Outcome] + [Timeframe] + [Price]

Examples:
- Roofing contractors get 50-100 qualified leads per month via Facebook ads for $3,000/month
- E-commerce brands increase revenue 15-25% through email optimization for $5,000/month
```

**Promise-Focused Framing:**
- Focus on WHAT they get, not WHAT you do
- Bad: "Social media management services"
- Good: "15-25 qualified appointments per month"

**Pricing Psychology:**
- $1K-$3K: Entry point for small businesses
- $3K-$5K: Sweet spot for established service businesses
- $5K-$10K: Premium positioning, requires strong proof
- Always contextualize: "$3K/month for 50-100 leads" (never "$3K/month" alone)

**Guarantee Structures:**
1. Performance: "50 leads or we work for free next month"
2. Time-based: "First results within 7 days or full refund"
3. Satisfaction: "30-day money-back guarantee"

**Validation Signals:**
- Hand raiser post gets 3+ engagements = validated
- 0 engagement after 3 posts = pivot offer promise

---

#### `/docs/hand-raiser-system.md`

Create complete lead generation playbook with:

**Platform Selection:**
- LinkedIn: B2B, professional services, SaaS ($5K+ deals)
- Facebook: Local services, B2C, e-commerce ($1K-$3K deals)

**2026 Organic Reach Reality:**
- Meta platforms have near-zero organic reach without existing engagement
- Solution: Build targeted network first (100 connections)
- Alternative: Small paid amplification ($5-10/day to warm audience)

**100-Connection Building Strategy:**
- Search: "[Job Title] + [Location/Industry]"
- Send 20-30 connection requests daily
- No custom message (higher acceptance rate)
- Stop at 100 targeted connections
- Timeline: 3-5 days

**Hand Raiser Post Templates:**

Provide 10+ variations:
1. Direct question: "Who needs [outcome] without [pain point]?"
2. Time-bound: "Looking for 3 [niche] who need [outcome] this month"
3. Budget anchor: "Who wants [deliverable] on a $[X] budget?"
4. Specific result: "Who needs [X number] of [deliverable]?"
5. Pain focus: "Tired of [pain]? I can help you get [outcome]"
6. Case study hook: "Just helped [niche] get [result]. Who else needs this?"
7. Outcome focus: "Who's trying to [goal] and needs [specific help]?"
8. Contrast: "Most [niche] struggle with [X]. Who wants [better outcome]?"
9. Timeframe: "Who needs [outcome] in the next [timeframe]?"
10. Social proof: "[X] [niche] got [result] this month. Who's next?"

**Post Timing & Frequency:**
- Frequency: 1x per day maximum
- LinkedIn best times: 7-9am or 5-6pm (local time)
- Facebook best times: 1-3pm or 7-9pm (local time)
- Rotate templates (don't repeat same post within 7 days)

**Response Handling:**
- Comment OR DM engagement → Send video within 4 hours
- Log in pipeline tracker immediately
- Use custom video (validation phase) or standardized video (post-validation)

**Market Validation Interpretation:**
- 3+ engaged prospects across 3 posts = Offer validated ✓
- 1-2 engagements = Possible, test 2 more posts
- 0 engagement after 3 posts = Pivot offer promise (NOT niche)

**Social Listening:**
- Monitor relevant Facebook groups for pain points
- Track LinkedIn posts from target niche about challenges
- Note language they use (adopt it in your posts)

---

#### `/docs/video-sales-system.md`

Create 5-part video methodology with:

**Complete 5-Part Structure:**

**Part 1: Hook (10-15 seconds)**
- Acknowledge their specific situation
- Reference their comment/DM language directly
- Examples by niche:
  - B2B: "Hey [Name], I saw you're looking to [specific goal from comment]..."
  - Local: "Hey [Name], noticed you need [outcome they mentioned]..."
  - E-com: "Hey [Name], saw you want to [revenue goal]..."

**Part 2: Outcome Demonstration (60-90 seconds)**
- Show what happens AFTER they work with you (not the process)
- Screen recording techniques:
  - Lead gen: Show dashboard with 47 calls in 30 days
  - Service: Show before/after comparison
  - Coaching: Play 10-second testimonial clip
- Visual proof > verbal description
- Play actual example if possible

**Part 3: Contextualized Price (20-30 seconds)**
- Formula: "$[PRICE] per [TIME] and you get [DELIVERABLE]"
- Examples:
  - "$3,000/month and you get 50-100 calls like I just showed"
  - "You get 20-30 booked appointments for $2,500/month"
- Anchor to value: "$3K for 50 leads = $60 per lead"
- NEVER state price without deliverable

**Part 4: Differentiation (30-45 seconds)**
- Address "tried this before" objection preemptively
- Focus on ONE differentiator:
  - Speed: "Unlike agencies that take 60 days, you see first calls within 7 days"
  - Process: "The difference is we target [X] instead of [Y]"
  - Guarantee: "We're the only ones who guarantee [outcome] or work free"

**Part 5: Purchase Instructions (20-30 seconds)**
- Exact payment steps:
  - "Click the Stripe link below"
  - "Enter your info"
  - "You'll get an onboarding email within 2 hours"
  - "First campaign launches in 7 days"
- Remove ALL friction from "yes" to "paid"

**Custom vs. Standardized Phases:**

Phase 1 - Offer Validation (First 10-20 prospects):
- Record custom Loom per prospect
- Personalize hook + message wrapper
- Identify recurring objections
- Refine script based on patterns

Phase 2 - Scaled Acquisition (Post-Validation):
- ONE standardized video for ALL prospects
- Personalize ONLY the message wrapper
- Template: "Hey [Name], I know you're trying to [goal]. Made this quick video with everything: [link]"

**2026 Video Best Practices:**
- Length: 4-5 minutes maximum
- "Video" in subject line (19%+ open rate boost)
- Captions enabled (many watch muted)
- Mobile-optimized (60%+ watch on mobile)
- Loom thumbnail: Show outcome dashboard/result

#### `/docs/text-closing-system.md`

Create post-video follow-up system with:

**Follow-Up Sequence Timing:**
- 24h: Check-in message
- 48h: Value-add message
- 72h: Soft close message
- 1 week: Final attempt message
- 1 week after final: Mark as COLD

**Message Templates:**

**24h Check-In:**
"Hey [Name], wanted to make sure you saw the video I sent yesterday. Let me know if you have any questions after watching."

**48h Value-Add:**
"Hey [Name], following up on the video. Most [niche] find the [specific part] most interesting. Here's an example of [additional proof point]. Curious what you think?"

**72h Soft Close:**
"Hey [Name], last check-in. If the timing's not right, totally understand. If you want to get started, just reply and I'll send payment details."

**1-Week Final Attempt:**
"Hey [Name], closing this opportunity on Friday. If you want the [outcome] we discussed, let me know by then. Otherwise I'll assume it's not the right fit right now."

**Question Handling:**

Situational Fit Questions:
- Q: "Does this work for [my specific situation]?"
- A: "Absolutely. The core approach is the same, we just adjust [small detail] for your situation. I've worked with [similar situation] clients before."
- 95% of the time: YES with minor calibration

Logistics Questions:
- Q: "How long does setup take?"
- A: "Setup takes [specific timeframe]. You'll see first [deliverable] within [timeframe]."

**Objection Response Scripts:**

"Tried this before":
- Acknowledge: "I totally get that. What specifically didn't work?"
- Differentiate: "The reason that didn't work is [X]. We handle that by [Y]."
- Proof: "Here's a client who had the same issue: [show result]"

"Too expensive":
- Reframe ROI: "At $X for Y leads, that's $Z per lead. If one converts to a $W job, you're profitable immediately."
- Payment plan: "I can split it into 2 payments of $X if that helps."
- Scale down: "I can do [smaller deliverable] for $[lower price] to start."

"Need to think about it":
- Timeline: "Totally fair. What's your timeline for deciding?"
- Specific concern: "Is there something specific you're unsure about?"
- Urgency: "I'm only taking on [X] new clients this month, so if you want the spot, let me know by [date]."

**Going Dark Re-Engagement:**
- 1 week: "Hey [Name], circling back. Still interested?"
- 2 weeks: "Hey [Name], last attempt. Still need [outcome]?"
- 1 month: "Hey [Name], saw you're [new trigger event]. Still looking for [outcome]?"
- Remove from pipeline after 1 month of no response

#### `/docs/fulfillment-system.md`

Create no-meeting delivery model with:

**Client Onboarding Template:**

Subject: Welcome to [Your Company] - Let's Get Started

Hi [Client Name],

Excited to start delivering [outcome] for you!

**What Happens Next:**
1. I'll need [list of required info/access]
2. Setup takes [timeline]
3. You'll see first [deliverable] by [date]
4. Weekly updates every [day] via Loom video

**How We Communicate:**
- Weekly progress: Loom video (3-5 minutes)
- Questions/issues: Email/Slack (4-hour response time)
- Deliverables: Loom walkthrough + files

**No Meetings:**
We don't do status calls. This saves your time and gives you updates on YOUR schedule. You can watch Loom videos anytime, rewatch as needed, and share with your team.

**Timeline:**
- [Date]: Setup complete
- [Date]: First [deliverable]
- [Day of week]: Weekly updates

Reply to this email with [required info] and we'll get started!

[Your Name]

**Expectation Setting Framework:**
- Explicitly state "no-meeting" model in onboarding
- Position as benefit: "Your time isn't wasted on status calls"
- Provide clear response time commitments (e.g., "4 hours during business hours")
- Over-communicate proactively via Loom

**Weekly Update Loom Structure (3-5 minutes):**
1. Introduction (5 seconds): "Hey [Client], quick update for week of [date]"
2. Progress update (60 seconds): What was completed this week
3. Metrics/results (60 seconds): Performance data with screen shares
4. Next steps (30 seconds): What's happening next week
5. Questions/action items (30 seconds): Anything needed from client

**Deliverable Handoff Process:**
1. Record Loom walkthrough (3-5 minutes) explaining deliverable
2. Send written summary with bullet points
3. Attach files/links
4. Request confirmation of receipt
5. If no confirmation within 24h, follow up

**Issue Resolution via Async:**
- Response time commitment: 4 hours during business hours
- Use Loom for complex issues (tone matters)
- Use text for simple clarifications
- Escalation path: If can't resolve within 24h, schedule call (rare exception)

**Client Communication Protocols:**
- Use video for: Weekly updates, deliverable handoffs, complex explanations
- Use text for: Quick questions, confirmations, scheduling
- Use screen shares for: Showing data, explaining processes, training

**Proactive Update Cadences:**
- Weekly updates: Every [set day]
- Major milestones: Immediate Loom
- Issues encountered: Same-day notification
- Monthly summary: First of month

**QC Checklist Before Handoff:**
- [ ] Deliverable matches agreed scope
- [ ] All required elements included
- [ ] Quality reviewed against standard
- [ ] Loom walkthrough recorded
- [ ] Written summary prepared

### Task 2: Verify State Tracking Infrastructure

**Check that these files exist and are functional:**

1. `system/STATE.json` - Should have been created by init command
2. `.claude/hooks/update-state.py` - Should be executable
3. `.claude/settings.json` - Should have PostToolUse hook configured

**Test state synchronization:**
1. Update CLAUDE.md Current State section (change any metric)
2. Verify STATE.json updates automatically (or run hook manually)
3. Confirm STATE.json reflects the change

If state tracking isn't working:
- Check hook file permissions: `ls -l .claude/hooks/update-state.py`
- Test hook manually: `python .claude/hooks/update-state.py`
- Verify settings.json has correct hook configuration
